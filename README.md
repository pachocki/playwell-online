# Technical Details
## Frontend
The frontend of the website is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The website's visual design is powered
by Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create fast-loading, mobile-friendly websites. To add interactive animations and improve
the user experience, we used GSAP, a powerful JavaScript animation library.
## Backend
 On the backend, we used Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, to handle server-side logic and routing. Express, a flexible 
 and minimal web application framework for Node.js, is used to handle HTTP requests and responses. Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, 
 is used to interact with the database and store user data.
 For payment processing, we used Stripe, a popular payment gateway that allows users to make payments securely and easily. With Stripe, we can accept 
 a wide range of payment methods, including credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more.

Overall, Playwell Online is a comprehensive platform that provides a fun and educational experience for kids while also giving them the opportunity to learn coding and problem-solving skills in a game-based environment.
